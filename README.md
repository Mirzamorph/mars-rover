Well, honestly I rarely do something like this
I developed game-like things but I used canvas, not just Dom manipulation(I think I should have used it here too)

I’ve spent about 2.10 hours with a pause
If I had more time I would use typescript(I had plenty of issues because of types there and my ide didn’t want to help me)
Also, I would refactor grid components, I find this generation a bit weird
And of course I would refactor console component, these switches really don’t belong there at all

Redux would be a good choice there, it was my mistake that I didn’t use it.
I wanted to refactor with “useReducer” hook, but didn’t have time left, “useState” hook doesn’t work comfortably with objects

It was an interesting task, I’m not sure it looked as a Mars rover after all :)
